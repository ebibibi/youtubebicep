# Bicep Authoring Devcontainer

This is a simple devcontainer which can be used with CodeSpaces or VSCode Remote to get all the tooling needed to start authoring bicep. 

## Quick Start: VSCode Remote

1. Clone the repository.
1. Configuration for the development environment by installing VSCode and the Devcontainers extension. [Quick start docs here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial).
1. Open the folder in VSCode
devcontain1. [`CTRL+SHIFT+P` then type `Reopen in container`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started) to open the devcontainer in VSCode.
1. [Open a terminal in VSCode with `CTRL+SHIFT+P` -> `Terminal: Create new integrated terminal`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_opening-a-terminal). We'll use this to run Bicep commands.
1. [Run `az login`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) from the VSCode terminal to connect to your Azure account.
1. Run `bicep build main.bicep` this will generate `main.json` which is the ARM template ready to be deployed.
1. Run the following to create a resource group and deploy the template to it.
```
	az group create -n my-rg -l eastus
	az deployment group create -f ./main.json -g my-rg
```

## Next Steps

Review [the docs here](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) to build out more advanced scenarios.

## Configuration 

To target a specific release of Bicep update the `./devcontainer/Dockerfile` argument `ARG BICEP_VERSION=latest` to the required version.
